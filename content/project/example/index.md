The total level of self-driving can be devided into 6 levels from L0 to L5. Nowadays, the level of self-driving car has reached to L3, which still requires some participation of drivers and cannot realize complete self-driving. We believe the presentation of end-to-end learning has pointed out a new way to a higher level of self-driving, and it can replace some technical redundancy of current self-driving solution.

Due to the inspiration from the paper “Variational End-to-End Navigation and Localization”, we designed and reproduced the network presented by the paper and got some useful result.
